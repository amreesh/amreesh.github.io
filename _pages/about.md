Bored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius">islander</a>, always trying to find a excuse to step on a plane in a perpetual quest for newness. Dad x3, trail runner, scuba diver and watercolour enthusiast in a past life...will get back to these one day.

Currently working as an Internet Measurement and Data Expert at ISOC to untangle this giant web. My research interests are in the broad area of computer networking, security, and telecommunication policy, with an emphasis on Internet measurements. I am focused on efforts around designing new tools and techniques to study the global health of the Internet including Internet resilience, routing security issues, Internet shutdowns, and other market trends that impact the growth of the Internet. I enjoy reviewing papers as a TPC member of several academic and technical conferences including USENIX SECURITY, IMC, PAM, TMA, etc.

I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, South Africa in 2021 and an M.Sc. in Information Security at the University of London, UK in 2013 as well as an M.S. in Computer Engineering at Telecom Nancy, France in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, I worked as a Guest Researcher at NIST in the Information Discovery, Use and Sharing division.
