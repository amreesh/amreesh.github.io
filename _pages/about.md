Bored islander :mauritius:, always trying to find a excuse to step on a plane in a perpetual quest for newness. Dad x3, trail runner, scuba diver and watercolour enthusiast in a past life...will get back to these one day.

Currently working as an Internet Measurement and Data Expert at ISOC to untangle this giant web. My research interests are in the broad area of computer networking, security, and telecommunication policy, with an emphasis on Internet measurements. I am focused on efforts around designing new tools and techniques to study the global health of the Internet including Internet resilience, routing security issues, Internet shutdowns, and other market trends that impact the growth of the Internet. Two such tools are the Internet Society <a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/resilience">Internet Resilience Index</a> and the <a href="https://pulse.internetsociety.org/netloss">Netloss calculator</a>.

At ISOC, I am co-leading the Measuring the Internet project and I am also running the Pulse Research Fellowship program. Recently, this has led me to work on some interesting topics including censorship measurements, LEO satellite performance and Internet resilience.

I enjoy reviewing papers as a TPC member of several academic and technical conferences including USENIX SECURITY, IMC, PAM, TMA, etc.
